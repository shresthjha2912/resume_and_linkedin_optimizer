**Features**

**Easy User Experience:**
- Resume Analyzer AI makes it easy for users. You can upload your resume and enter your OpenAI API key without any hassle. The application is designed to be user-friendly so that anyone can use its powerful resume analysis features.
- It also uses the PyPDF2 library to quickly extract text from your uploaded resume, which is the first step in doing a thorough analysis.

**Smart Text Analysis with Langchain:**
- What makes it special is how it analyzes text. It uses a smart method called the Langchain library to break long sections of text from resumes into smaller chunks, making them more meaningful.
- This clever technique improves the accuracy of the resume analysis, and it gives users practical advice on how to enhance their job prospects.

**Enhanced OpenAI Integration with FAISS:**
- Seamlessly connecting to OpenAI services, the application establishes a secure connection using your OpenAI API key. This integration forms the basis for robust interactions, facilitating advanced analysis and efficient information retrieval.
- It uses the FAISS(Facebook AI Similarity Search) library to convert both the text chunks and query text data into numerical vectors, simplifying the analysis process and enabling the retrieval of pertinent information.

**Intelligent Chunk Selection in RAG and LLM:**
- The application retrieves relevant text by comparing the user query with stored vector embeddings and selecting the Top K documents based on their similarity scores. This ensures that only the most relevant information is considered for further processing.
- Once the most relevant documents are selected, the system initializes a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically the ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo model to analyze and generate responses based on the retrieved content.

**Robust Question-Answering Pipeline:**
- The QA pipeline processes the Top K documents and the user query to generate meaningful responses. The system extracts relevant information from the retrieved content, ensuring accuracy and coherence.
- The LLM analyzes the selected documents and formulates responses by understanding the context within the retrieved text. This approach enhances response quality by focusing on the most relevant data instead of relying solely on the initial query.

**Comprehensive Resume Analysis:**
- **Summary:** Resume Analyzer AI provides a quick, comprehensive overview of resumes, emphasizing qualifications, key experience, skills, projects, and achievements. Users can swiftly grasp profiles, enhancing review efficiency and insight.
- **Strength:** Effortlessly conducting a comprehensive resume review, it analyzes qualifications, experience, and accomplishments. It subsequently highlights strengths, providing job seekers with a competitive edge.
- **Weakness:** AI conducts thorough analysis to pinpoint weaknesses and offers tailored solutions for transforming them into strengths, empowering job seekers.
- **Suggestion:** AI provides personalized job title recommendations that align closely with the user's qualifications and resume content, facilitating an optimized job search experience.
